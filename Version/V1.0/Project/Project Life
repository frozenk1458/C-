Create Socket connection allowing several clients to connect to the server.

A calculator is in construction : The function coded can calculate with only one operator. We have still some difficulties to code a calculator with several operator.

Add modularities in client.cs. Some connexion attemps have been made. The first step is a simple connexion with just the login.
We try to enter a login and enter in connexion function in the server side but it's not working yet.
We work on a proper connexion function working as itself.
Final objectives : On the client side, the user enter a login and a password and send it to the server. The server open a login/password file
or connect to the DB to compare if it find a matching couple login/password. If a correspondence is found the server return a code 0 to the client otherwise a code 1 is returned.
Then the client is invited to enter again his/her login/password.


The main objective now is : Every job have to be made on the server side and return a code to the client side.
It is not working yet. Every entry is not properly handled. 

1) Connexion with just a login done: If you tap "Connect" as a command your enter in connexion function. 
  In the client side, the prompt ask to enter a login. For now if you enter the login "login" you are connected. If another login is entered the prompt ask to enter again a login.
2) Connexion with login and password works. Follow instructions given.
